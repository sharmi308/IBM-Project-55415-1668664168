ML depends heavily on data, without data, it is impossible for a machine to learn.
It is the most crucial aspect that makes algorithm training possible. In Machine Learning projects, we need a training data set.
It is the actual data set used to train the model for performing various actions.
TensorFlow already has MNist Data set so there is no need to explicitly download or create Dataset 
The MNSIT dataset contains ten classes: Digits from 0-9. Each digit is taken as a class
